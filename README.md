# Nemesis-the-Warlock
C64 Source Code to Nemesis the Warlock 
(c)Michael J Archer

One of the first examples of sprite duplication to have tall sprites using same sprite number. Using the overlapping technique.
A shout out to an old friend Simon Nickol, and also Stavros Fasoulas who I beleive was one of the first people to discover this thechnique, I'm not 100% sure from memory if this was correct.

Development Started on 29th December 1986
The Source code was cross compiled via a BBC Micro computer witha parallel data link between the BBC user port and C64 port.
The C64 had a modified ROM which I hotlinked my communication code which copyied itself to zero page, to allow entire memory to download to.
This long since gone, but I have the Cable still, and the download side on the BBC was written into a custom BBC SWR (Side Ways Rom)
